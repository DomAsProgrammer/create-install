WHAT IS create-install.pl ?
===========================
This intractive script builds files of your explicit installed
Archlinux' pacman's packages. This files are two scripts and
one textfile.
The scripts can be executed directly after reboot of your fresh
system for reinstalling your pre-decided packages.
This way you haven't to remember every of your wished packages.
Helpful for multible installations.


FEATURES
========
- creates ready to use scripts for reinstallation.
- no base packages will be installed. I experienced
    reinstallation of base packages can cause big issues.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
=====================
Perl
- Perl 5.22.2 or higher


DOCUMENTATION
=============
Just execute create_install.pl . There are no options or
arguments. After execution it will need some time to collect
informations about your installed packages. After this you will
be asked what to do:
    yes     => opens vim where you can edit the list of programms
    No      => continues with the complete list
    quit    => exits this program and removes all temp files
    help    => prints this help
"No" will create the scripts with collected informations. Default by ENTER
"quit" will exit program without creating anything.
"yes" will give you a list with two columns: 
    [PACKAGE NAME]    - [DESCRIPTION]
 - delete a line to omit package
 - change package name, if you want a special version (e.g. vi â†’ vim)
 - create a new line and write package name in to add this to scripts
After execution (and not quitting) you'll find one to three new files in
the same directory like create_install.pl :

- instpacman_yourhost_YYYY-MM-DD.sh
    All packets, which can be installed via pacman will be
    collected as runable script in the first script.

- instyaourt_yourhost_YYYY-MM-DD.sh
    Packets, which can be installt from AUR via yaourt,
    will be collected as runable script in the second
    script like the first. (This script will only be created
    if yaourt is available.)

- instnot_yourhost_YYYY-MM-DD.txt
    Any manually compiled (and via pacman installed) packets
    will be listed in the third textfile. (This script will
    only be created if there are any packages, which are not
    found in yaourt or pacman.)
